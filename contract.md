1. When and where will we schedule meetings (e.g. 11am Wednesdays and 2pm Fridays: in-person at X location, or on Teams video call)?

2. How will meeting hosts be planned so that team members share the leading of meetings equally?

3. Where will we record our meeting minutes (Gitlab Wiki or Gitlab markdown file)?

4. How many days before the iteration due date do we expect individual tasks to be completed by (i.e. when is our internal deadline(s))? 

5. What is the expected response time for messages/posts on MS Teams when communicating with each other?

6. What is the expected turn-around time for reviewing merge requests? What is our approach to conducting code reviews?

7. How will we handle conflicts (i.e. differing opinions)? Note: If conflicts cannot resolved this way, please contact your tutor.

8. List the steps a team member does if they get stuck (e.g. stuck debugging).

9. A day before the due date we notice a team member's work is very broken and incomplete. Instead of waiting until the due date, list the steps we will take to prevent this from occuring in the first place. Note: contact your tutor if this happens as well.
